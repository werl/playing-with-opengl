# Playing With OpenGL
This is where I'm learning to work with C++ and what it takes to make a game from scratch

## Included Libraries
Libraries and the versions I'm using.
* [GLBinding 2.1.1](https://github.com/cginternals/glbinding)
* [GLFW 3.2.1](http://www.glfw.org)
* [GLM 0.9.8](http://glm.g-truc.net/0.9.8/index.html)
* [stb Image 2.12](https://github.com/nothings/stb)

## Compiling
I have only tested it under MacOS as of right now, but there are plans to make sure it builds Windows and Linux as well.

1. ```cd``` into the downloaded directory
2. ```cmake .```
3. ```make```

in order for it to run you must run it form the current dirrectory in the terminal

## What This Accomplishes
Honestly, I don't see much happening with this. It is just a place for me to play.
